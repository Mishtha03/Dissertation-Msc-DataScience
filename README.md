Financial forecasting is critical in contemporary finance because it helps decision-makers make educated investment decisions while limiting risks and maximising rewards. Under-
standing current occurrences is the greatest way to forecast the future. The purpose is to investigate the feasibility of using previous stock price and trading volume data to forecast
future price changes. In this study three companies data is taken namely Apple, Barclays Bank and IBM where deep learning and time series algorithm is applied in order to predict
which models performs the best. The study approach entails gathering and preprocessing historical daily stock price and trade volume data for the firms under consideration.
The study approach entails gathering and preprocessing historical daily stock price and trade volume data for the selected firms. Some machine learning algorithms like Sequential models,
Recurrent neural network and Hybrid model of Recurrent neural network and Bidirectional LSTM and performance of each model is comapred. This studyâ€™s findings illustrate the
usefulness and limits of several forecasting methodologies for stock price prediction. The study also emphasises the necessity of feature engineering, hyperparameter adjustment, and
suitable data pretreatment in improving predicting accuracy.
While judging the model performance evaluation is done on the basics of performance metrics like mean squared error, root mean square and mean absolute error. The findings demonstrate
the ability of LSTM neural networks to detect subtle patterns and trends in stock price data, making them particularly suitable for long-term forecasting. Finally graphical analysis is
done and plotted of future stock price forecasting for next 1 week and the result is compared with the live data stock price.The ramifications of accurate stock price projections extend be-
yond investing decisions to risk management, portfolio optimisation, and strategic planning. The study emphasises the importance of constantly refining and adapting forecasting models
as market dynamics change. The main motive of this project is to forecast the future price of stock for a compare as accurately as possible which is vital important for trading strategy
and investment so that return of investment is maximized.
